# Data Analysis Portfolio | N.S.P Educational & Tourism Institute (2022–2024)

**This repository is a real-world business analytics case study**, based on two years of operational data from a private education and training institute, where I acted as the **sole data analyst responsible for turning raw registrations into strategic decisions.**

This project is not a historical report. It is a **collection of analytical frameworks, revenue models, segmentation strategies, and behavioural insights** that demonstrate how I approach business problems with data.

---

## Business Context

The institute was facing several commercial challenges:

- Highly **volatile demand** across seasons

- **Low student retention** and limited loyalty

- No clear understanding of **which courses actually drive profit**

- Weak visibility into **regional performance and marketing ROI**

- No data-driven framework for **bundling, pricing, or scheduling**

---

## My Role

As the Data Analyst, I:

- Designed the **data model** from transactional registration records

- Built **revenue, cohort, and behavioural metrics**

- Developed **segmentation logic** for students, courses, and regions

- Produced **automated reports** and an **interactive Tableau dashboard**

- Delivered **commercial recommendations** to management

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

This project showcases my ability to:

- Translate **messy operational data** into business-ready datasets

- Build **KPIs and metrics** for revenue, retention, and demand

- Perform **cohort, segmentation, and funnel analysis**

- Identify **profit drivers vs volume drivers**

- Support **pricing, marketing, and capacity decisions**

- Communicate insights through **clear dashboards and reports**

## Key Business Insights

### Revenue Drivers

- Barista courses were the largest single revenue stream
- A small subset of courses generated a disproportionate share of income

### Seasonality

- Summer and autumn were peak demand and revenue periods
- Capacity planning and staffing should be aligned with these cycles

### Customer Loyalty

- Only 17% of students returned
- However, this group generated over 25% of total revenue

### Regional Performance

- Shiraz generated ~58% of total income
- Several smaller provinces showed high revenue per student, indicating expansion potential

### Behavioural Patterns

- Most multi-course purchases happened on the same day
- Certain course pairs (e.g., Burger + Pizza) showed natural bundling behaviour

---

## Interactive Dashboard

A Tableau dashboard was built to allow management to explore:

- Revenue and enrolment by time, course, and region
- Loyalty vs first-time customer behaviour
- Course combinations and purchasing patterns
- Seasonal and regional trends
