# Data Analysis Portfolio | N.S.P Educational & Tourism Institute (2022–2024)

This project presents a comprehensive **data analysis and business insight report** based on real registration data from the **N.S.P Educational and Tourism Institute**, located in Shiraz, Iran.

The work was conducted during my **two-year tenure (Feb 2022 – Apr 2024)** as a Data Analyst at the institute. It includes valuable insights on understanding trends in enrolment, course popularity, regional engagement, revenue generation, and student loyalty.
