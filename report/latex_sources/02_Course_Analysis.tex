\section*{1. Overall Course Popularity}
According to Figure~\ref{fig:most-popular-courses}, Barista courses are by far the most popular, attracting 104 students, followed by Pizza (69 students) and Burger (51 students). Courses such as Traditional, Kabab, and Fried Chicken have significantly lower student numbers, indicating niche or low-demand areas.

\section*{2. Seasonal Distribution of Students per Course}
As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:seasonal-courses}, Barista maintains consistent popularity across all seasons, peaking in summer.  
Pizza also performs strongly throughout the year with the highest count in summer.  
Some courses such as Bread and Kabab only gain traction in autumn, indicating possible seasonal preferences or scheduling limitations.  
Courses like Traditional are only present in spring, showing minimal or one-time offerings.

\section*{3. Monthly Dynamics by Course Type}
The heatmap in Figure~\ref{fig:heatmap-course-month} provides a detailed view of course engagement across time:  
Barista and Pizza have consistently high participation every month, especially in July and November.  
Burger courses peaked in May, July, and November.  
Several lower-enrolment courses have patchy presence (e.g., Traditional only appears once).  
The heatmap also suggests summer and autumn as peak periods for a wide variety of courses.

\section*{Summary}
Barista and Pizza dominate in terms of student interest and consistency.  
Seasonality influences the demand for some courses, notably in summer and autumn.  
A few courses have sporadic or limited availability, possibly due to resource constraints or experimental offerings.
