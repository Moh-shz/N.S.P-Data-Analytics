\section*{1. Frequency of Registration Gaps (Days Between Registrations)}
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:reg-gap}, the median gap between registrations is 1 day, while the mean is 35.3 days due to a few outliers. Most multi-course enrollments occur within 1 day, indicating a strong tendency toward batch registration.

\section*{2. Most Popular Course Combinations in Student Baskets}
Figure~\ref{fig:combo-basket} shows that \textit{burger + pizza} is the most common bundle, followed by \textit{nugget + sausage} and other fast-food combinations.

\section*{3. Registration Sequences with 2 Courses}
Figure~\ref{fig:seq2} demonstrates that \textit{burger $\rightarrow$ pizza} is the leading sequential choice.

\section*{4. Registration Sequences with 3 Courses}
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:seq3}, only a handful of students follow three-step sequences, the most popular being \textit{burger $\rightarrow$ pizza $\rightarrow$ fried\_chicken}.

\section*{5. Course Registration Network}
Figure~\ref{fig:network} displays the overall registration network, highlighting transition pathways between courses.

\section*{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Most multi-course registrations happen within 1 day, showing planned or bundled registrations.
    \item Burger and pizza courses dominate both combinations and sequences.
    \item These findings are valuable for designing bundles, recommending next courses, and understanding the actual learning journey.
\end{itemize}
